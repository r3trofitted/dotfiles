# .dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to use them as they are, or take inspiration from them, 
but keep in mind that a) they are meant for a single user (me) and a single OS (MacOS) and 
b) I'm not so good at shell and MacOS scripting, so they may be buggy, dangerous and/or 
inefficient.

If you haven't done so already, you should definitely pay a visit to the [dotfiles community]
(https://dotfiles.github.io), where you'll find a lot of (most certainly better) dotfiles.
